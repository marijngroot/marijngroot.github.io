								<p>This map shows bird sightings in The Netherlands, with data collected using an Esri Field App which I designed. Different colours represent the species of the birds, while the size of a feature point represents the number of individuals of that species during a specific sighting.</p>

								<p>In this lab assignment, I developed an app using Esri Field Maps, a useful tool for data collection and analysis in the field. The main objective of the app was to allow users to enter data directly into a map through an easily accessible and understandable form, enabling real-time data collection and subsequent graphing and analysis. For my map, I decided to focus on bird sightings and their relevant data entries.</p>

								<p>To begin with, I decided to focus on bird prevalence as the primary area of investigation. I wanted to monitor bird sightings of the most commonly occurring Dutch bird species, as this may provide insights into the distribution and frequency of different bird species across various regions and throughout different times of the year.</p>

								<p>To achieve this, I designed an interactive map interface that displayed dots representing previous bird sightings. Each dot was assigned a unique colour corresponding to its specific bird species. The size of the dots was determined by the number of birds observed in each sighting, providing a quick visual representation of bird abundance. Additionally, I incorporated labels within the dots, clearly indicating the name of the species (as it may be difficult to remember which species belongs to which colour for the number of species that I included). This ensured that users could easily identify and interpret the information displayed on the map.</p>

								<p>To facilitate the data entry by users in the field, I developed a comprehensive data entry form within the app. The form allowed users to select the location, and date and time of each bird sighting. To ensure accuracy and consistency, I implemented a convenient drop-down menu for selecting the bird species from a list of the most common Dutch species. This eliminated the potential for typos or misspellings and maintained data integrity. Other data that were collected through the form were the count of the sighting (so, how many individuals of the relevant bird species were seen at the same time), the potential presence or visibility of a nest, the number of potential chicks that were present, and an empty space for extra notes, as well as the option to indicate how much joy the bird sighting brought the user on a scale of 0-4 (with descriptions ranging from "No joy", through “Somewhat charming.”, “A pleasant experience.”, and “Highly delightful!” to "SUCH JOY").</p>

								<p>It quickly became apparent that this “joy factor” sparked a lot of enthusiasm among the users of the app, including myself, my friends, and my family members. Over the course of the week, we all worked hard on including every bird we encountered in the map. As a result of these contributions and the active engagement of all users, the field map quickly turned into a happy and colourful collection of dots, spread out all across The Netherlands, each dot representing a unique bird sighting. If it were to be continued for a longer period of time and with more active contributors, the display would certainly show the distribution and patterns of various bird species across the country, offering insights into their prevalence and seasonal variations.</p>

								<p>Being highly enthusiastic about my bird collections, I created a range graphs of the data in the web version of the field map, including graphs of the proportion of each species in the total bird count, the sightings across time per species, the average number of chicks (if at all seen) of each species, and the mean joy factor per species.</p>

								<p>This assignment has showed me how to create an easy tool for field data collection, and has simultaneously highlighted the importance of user accessibility; especially the feedback session in which we talked our classmates through our experience using their apps was eye-opening in the respect of how some elements that seem completely logical to ourselves can be entirely counter-intuitive to others. This is something I will take with me in future designing activities.</p>
